Number Guessing Game

This is the first program made while doing the Treehouse Python Techdegree course. 

The user will be prompted to input a number between 1-50. The goal is to guess the secret number using as few guesses as possible. When the correct number is entered, the user is told how many guesses they used and asked if they would like to try again. If yes, then the current high score will be displayed. 


Critera:

- Program runs, any exceptions are caught and handled, preventing crashes while its running.

- When run, the program displays an initial intro/welcome message before or above the menu.

- The player receives the correct feedback for their choice:
If the solution is higher than the guess, display "It's higher".
If the solution is lower than the player's guess, display "It's lower"

- When the player chooses to play the game again, a new random number within the range is chosen each time.

- The player cannot enter a number that is outside the number range. If the player tries they are informed that number was not a valid option and to try again.

- Display a high score (number of least guesses) at the start of a new game so the player knows the goal they are trying to beat.

- Instead of just ending the game each time, ask the user if they would like to play again.
    If yes, then cycle the user back into guessing a number again.
    If no, then provide the user with an ending/quit/goodbye message.
