Number Guessing Game

This is the first program made while doing the Treehouse Python Techdegree course. 

The user will be prompted to input a number between 1-50. The goal is to guess the secret number using as few guesses as possible. When the correct number is entered, the user is told how many guesses they used and asked if they would like to try again. If yes, then the current high score will be displayed.
